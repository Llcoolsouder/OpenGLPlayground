\hypertarget{index_Summary}{}\section{Summary}\label{index_Summary}
This project serves as a sandbox in which to learn and practice Open\+GL\hypertarget{index_Main}{}\section{Topics}\label{index_Main}
The focus of these exercises will be in understanding high-\/performance computing and some computer graphics, thus the topics will include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compute Shaders
\item Multi-\/pass rendering
\item Fluid simulation on the G\+PU
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_My}{}\section{Method}\label{index_My}
Everything will be done the hard way first (i.\+e. type out A\+L\+LL the code). Functionality will only be abstracted to a class or function when it is fully understood. As a test, when abstracting, I will not be looking at the code that I am {\itshape essentially} copying. This should give me one last chance to type out the code while focusing on what it does and how it works--and of course this is also good for memory.
